🛍️ Black Friday Sales Analysis

This project explores customer purchasing behavior during Black Friday sales for ABC Private Limited using the Black Friday Sales dataset
 from Kaggle.

It is part of my data science learning journey and follows my first project from the WorldQuant University Applied Data Science Lab — Housing in Mexico.

📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze customer demographics and purchase patterns to help ABC Private Limited better understand its target audience and optimize marketing strategies during large sale events.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, I uncover insights into factors influencing customer purchases such as age, gender, city category, and product type.

🧩 Key Steps
1. Data Import and Cleaning

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Handled missing values and checked for data consistency.

Cleaned and structured the dataset for further analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated descriptive statistics and summaries.

Explored relationships between features like gender, age, and purchase amount.

3. Data Visualization

Created insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:

Bar charts – to compare purchase amounts across demographics.

Pie charts – to show customer distribution by gender.

Boxplots – to visualize purchase spread and detect outliers.

🧠 Insights Gained

Single male customers showed higher average purchase values than female customers.

26-35 age group contributed the most to total sales.

Category B customers tended to spend more compared to those from other cities.

Occupation 4 had the highest purchase amount.
